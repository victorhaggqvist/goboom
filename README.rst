Description
===========
goboom is wrapper around the dmenu.
goboom is the successor and rewrite of xboomx in Go.

goboom sorts commands to launch according to their launch frequency.
In other words - if you launch Chromium and KeePassX all the time - they will appear in the list of commands first.

Build
-----
goboom is built using Go 1.5 vendoring and godeps.

Install
-------
goboom is available via AUR as `goboom-bin`. For binary downloads see `releases`_.

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo cp goboom /usr/bin
    sudo cp goboom_run /usr/bin
    mkdir -p ~/.goboom
    cp config.ini.default ~/.goboom/config.ini

Options
=======

--gc         Run garbage collection of the DB
--launcher   Output launcher command
--post       Update ranking DB
--pre        Generate dmenu in
--stats      View DB stats

Migration from xboomx
=====================
goboom will look for a config file in `~/.goboom`.
You will need to will need to convert you old config file to ini-format and name it `config.ini`, see the bundled default ini-file for guidence.

goboom uses a csv-file instead sqlite as datastore.
You will need to export your xboomx db as so.
At this point there is not a provided tool to do so, but you can easely export it with something like `sqlitebrowser`_.

.. _sqlitebrowser: http://sqlitebrowser.org/

The contents of your exported database should look along the lines of this::

    name,count
    chroimum,13
    keepassx,17
    gimp,4
